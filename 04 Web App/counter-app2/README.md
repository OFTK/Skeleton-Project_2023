# CounterApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.1.3.

# What I Did to Make it Work
1. Install node.js in sersion 16.X.X (to work properly with the package aspnet.signalr).
2. Install the correct version of angular-cli: `npm install @angular/cli@7.1.3`.
3. Install aspnet.signalr: `npm install @aspnet.signalr`.
4. Start a new project with `ng new <YOUR SERVER'S NAME>`
5. copy the `src` directory from the `counter-app` folder into the directory that you created with the `ng new` command, and replace the files in the destination
6. run `ng serve` inside that folder.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
